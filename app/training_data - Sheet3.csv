"Non-Exempt Status - Employees classified as non-exempt are generally paid on an hourly basis and occupy non-supervisory, clerical, or support positions. These Employees are eligible for applicable overtime pay and must be provided meal and rest periods.",HR
"Exempt Status – Exempt means a Employee is not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) overtime provisions or the Industrial Welfare Commission (IWC) Wage Order sections pertaining to overtime, minimum wage, record keeping, uniforms and equipment, meal periods, and rest periods. Where the state and federal regulations conflict the more restrictive requirement, is the one California employers must follow. Job title or salary does not classify an employee as Exempt. The employees work must be relatively high-level work and exempt level employees must be paid at least $33,280 annually.",HR
It is up to employers to determine whether to classify an employee as exempt or nonexempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).,HR
"Most employers believe that so long as an employee is paid a salary, they are exempt from the requirement to pay overtime wages. This is not correct. Income or salary alone does not determine exempt status, and salaried employees are not automatically exempted from overtime compensation. Job titles do not designate an employee as exempt or non-exempt.",HR
"To comply with the FLSA, employers need to regularly review their employee classifications. Generally, two requirements must be met to classify an employee as exempt:
1) They must earn a salary and
2) Hold a position with duties the U.S. Labor Department designates as appropriate for exempt positions.",HR
"Those positions generally fall into six categories: executive, administrative, learned professional, computer professional, creative professional and outside sales.
Use the Exempt vs. Non-Exempt checklist to be sure you are classifying employees correctly.",HR
"AUDIT: TEST YOUR COMPLIANCE
To be considered exempt from overtime, an employee must generally be paid on a salary basis and his job duties must meet the Labor Department’s standards for one of the six exemption categories discussed below.",HR
"Those who’ve completed the educational requirements for a law or medical degree need not meet the minimum salary requirement. Also, teachers need not be certified or meet the minimum salary requirement to qualify as learned professionals.",HR
"Correct classification is very important as misclassification of exempt or non-exempt status may result in a combination of fines, penalties, or the payment of unpaid wages, as imposed by the Department of Labor (DOL).",HR
"Willful violations may result in criminal prosecution and employers may be fined up to $10,000. Second convictions may result in imprisonment. Employers who willfully or repeatedly violate the minimum wage or overtime pay provisions of the FLSA also are subject to civil money penalties of up to $1,100 for each violation.",HR
"Work Schedules
Managers should advise their Employees of their individual schedules. Staffing needs and operational demands may necessitate variations in starting and ending times, as well as variations in the total hours that may be scheduled each day and week.",HR
"Ensure that you are very clear, during an interview and when you make a job offer, as to what the work schedule will be. If you must make scheduling changes due to business needs, do everything you can to accommodate Employees. If, however, schedules need to change based on real business reasons and Employees cannot work the new shift, you may discharge them based on the fact they cannot meet the new scheduling needs.",HR
"Timekeeping Tips
Timekeeping is a critical element of sound payroll practices that is commonly mishandled by employers, leading to potential liability. Employers who do not maintain complete and accurate records of the hours worked by their employees are unlikely to pay their employees properly, and can encounter great difficulty in defending themselves against claims filed by their employees.",HR
"In order to minimize their risk of liability and put themselves in the best position possible to defend against claims, employers should implement the following timekeeping practices:
 Record starting and stopping times, not just total hours of work- Non-exempt employees should record the times at which they begin work, begin any meal period(s), end their meal period(s), and conclude work for the day. Many employers expose themselves to liability by maintaining records which reflect only total hours worked each day, or by failing to maintain records that reflect the times at which meal periods began and ended. Records which reflect the exact same starting and ending times each day are often greeted with skepticism, since employees rarely, if ever, begin and end at precisely the same times each day.",HR
"Insist that employees record their own time- In order to preclude employees from arguing that a manager has recorded their hours of work incorrectly, employers should insist that employees record their own hours of work each day.",HR
"Insist that employees record their time on a daily basis- In some instances employees may become lazy and be tempted to record all of their work hours for a particular week or pay period on the last day. Employees generally are unable to remember the precise times at which they began and ended work each day throughout an entire payroll period. In order to maximize the accuracy of their records, employers should insist that employees record their work hours on a daily basis.",HR
"Timekeeping is a critical step in the payroll process that is often neglected by employers. By following the basic policies outlined above, employers can minimize their risk of liability for inadequate timekeeping.",HR
"Waiting Time or On Call Payment Requirements
Calculating the hours worked by non-exempt employees is generally a straightforward task, but complications may arise when employees spend time waiting for work or in ""on call"" status. Time devoted to these activities can constitute work time in some circumstances and should be counted as hours worked.",HR
"Waiting time
In some industries workflow may fluctuate substantially throughout the day, leaving employees with little or nothing to do at certain times and overwhelmed with work at others. During the slow periods of the day, employees may be idle while they wait for work flow to increase again.",HR
"In general, employers are required to pay non-exempt employees for all time during which the employee is on duty. If the employee is off duty, periods during which he is completely relieved of any obligation to the employer do not constitute hours worked if
a) they are long enough to enable the employee to use the time effectively for personal purposes, and
b) the employee is told in advance that he can leave the work site and will not have to return until a specified time.",HR
"Waiting time is likely to be considered hours worked when it is unpredictable and of short duration, such that the employee cannot effectively use the time for his or her own purposes. Examples of waiting time that would constitute hours worked include time spent by a courier waiting for an assignment, time spent by a fireman waiting for a call or an alarm, or time spent by an office worker waiting to resume work after an IT technician fixes his or her computer. In these situations, waiting is treated as an integral part of the employee’s job and therefore constitutes time worked.",HR
"“On call” time
Closely related to waiting time is the concept of “on call” status. The nature of some jobs requires employees to be “on call,” ready to respond to business or customer needs whenever they may arise. Some employees carry pagers or cellular telephones, for example, so that their supervisors can contact them and direct them to respond quickly to emergencies. This common scenario creates issues similar to those that arise with waiting time.",HR
"Time spent “on call” by non-exempt employees represents time worked, and is compensable, if the employee is
a) required to remain on the employer’s premises, or
b) required to remain so close to the workplace that the employee cannot effectively use the time for personal purposes.",HR
"Time spent “on call” by employees who are required to be available to answer questions by phone, but are otherwise able to do as they please is unlikely to be regarded as time worked.",HR
"When a non-exempt employee is actually required to perform work while on call, special rules governing the calculation of hours worked may apply.",HR
"If the employee was not otherwise regularly scheduled to work on the day in question, the employer’s payment obligation varies depending on the number of hours worked:
 If the employee works more than half of his or her usually-scheduled day of work, the employer must pay the employee for all hours worked.",HR
"If the employee works less than half of his or her usually-scheduled day of work, the employee is entitled to be paid half of the wages earned on a usual day, provided that the amount paid shall be equivalent to no less than two hours of pay and no more than four hours of pay. A full-time employee required to work for three hours while on call is thus entitled to payment for four hours.
 If an employee is required to report to work for the second time in a single day (regardless of whether the employee was regularly scheduled to work on that day or not) and works less than
two hours after reporting for the second time in the day, the company must pay the employee for a minimum of two hours of work.",HR
"Proper calculation of hours worked by non-exempt employees is a basic but important task for employers, and mistakes regarding waiting time and on-call time are common.",HR
"Administrative Pay Corrections
If there is an error in the amount an Employee is paid, the Employee should promptly bring the discrepancy to the attention of Management or the payroll department so that corrections can be made as quickly as possible. Do not wait until the next pay period to pay employees wages earned in the current pay period.",HR
"Deductions from Wages
An employer can lawfully withhold amounts from an employee’s wages only:
(1) when required or empowered to do so by state or federal law, or
(2) when a deduction is expressly authorized in writing by the employee to cover insurance premiums, benefit plan contributions or other deductions not amounting to a repayment on the employee’s wages.",HR
"Although a wage garnishment is a lawful deduction from wages under Labor Code section 224, an employer cannot discharge an employee because the employee’s wages have been subjected to a garnishment for the payment of a judgment.",HR
"The ability of an employer to deduct amounts from an employee’s wages due to a cash shortage, breakage, or loss of equipment is specifically regulated by the Industrial Welfare Commission Orders and limited by court decisions. Labor Code Section 224 clearly prohibits any deduction from an employee’s wages which is not either authorized by the employee in writing or permitted by law.",HR
"Balloon payment on separation of employment to repay an employee’s debt is an unlawful deduction even where the employee authorized such payment in writing. Employers may not deduct negative vacation, sick or PTO amounts from an employee’s final check.",HR
"Business Expenses
An employee is entitled to be reimbursed by his or her employer for all expenses or losses incurred in the performance of the employee’s work duties.",HR
"Employers should set internal deadlines and procedures for expense reimbursement. However, Employers may not withhold reimbursement to employees for missed deadline on reimbursement request or lack of receipt for expenses the employee incurred on behalf of the employer.",HR
"Overtime
You may require your Employees to work overtime as necessary; as much notice as possible should be provided when the need for overtime work arises. Managers should authorize all overtime work.",HR
"Employees are provided time-and-one-half the Employee's regular rate of pay for:
 All hours worked beyond eight in a single workday;
 All hours worked beyond forty straight-time hours in a ""workweek""; and
 The first eight hours worked on the seventh consecutive day worked in a single workweek regardless of hours worked in the week.",HR
"Employees are paid double the Employee's regular rate of pay for:
 All hours worked beyond twelve in a single workday; and
 The hours worked beyond eight on the seventh consecutive day worked in a single workweek.",HR
"You do not have to pay Employees who voluntarily come in before their regular starting time or remain after their shift ends for such periods as long as they do not engage in any work. However, if the Employee is engaged in any work, the Employee must be paid, even if the time comprises overtime.",HR
"Rest Breaks
Non-exempt Employees must be provided rest breaks at the rate of not less than 10 consecutive minutes for each four hours (or major portion thereof) worked, occurring as near as possible to the middle of the work period.",HR
"You may not combine rest breaks or add them to meal breaks, even at the Employee's request. Nor may they be used to allow an Employee to come in 10 minutes late or leave 10 minutes early. You control rest breaks, thus, you must pay break time as time worked. You may require Employees to remain on the premises during the rest break.",HR
"Meal Breaks
Non-Exempt employees must be provided a meal break of at least one half-hour for every work period of more than five hours. However, if six hours of work will complete the day's work, the Employee may voluntarily choose not to take the meal break. Meal breaks may be unpaid only if:
 They are at least 30 minutes long;
 The Employee is relieved of all duty; and
 The Employee is free to leave the premises.",HR
Meal breaks may be longer than a half-hour at your discretion. Provide a second meal break of no fewer than 30 minutes for all workdays on which an Employee works more than 10 hours.,HR
"Workers' Compensation /Accident Reporting
All full-time, part-time, and temporary Employees are covered under the Workers' Compensation Act for injuries and illnesses resulting from their employment. Coverage includes payment for health care costs and loss of earnings due to time lost from work.",HR
"The law requires the employer to file an Employer’s Report of Occupational Injury within five days after knowledge of an injury, accident, incident and illnesses.",HR
"Filing the Employer’s report does not constitute an admission of liability. If you question a claim, state your reservations on a separate sheet to be submitted with the Employer’s report. If you know of any previous injuries they too should be reported as it might impact the benefit.",HR
Do not send Employees to their own physician. Employee must pre-designate a physician before an injury occurs and their physician must sign the pre-designation.,HR
"If an Employee refuses medical treatment, have them sign a Refusal of Medical Treatment form. Employees may change their mind about medical treatment but must go to an authorized workers compensation facility for their care.",HR
Notify Centricity Solutions of any accidents or injuries so we may assist in the claim process and assist with OSHA 300 reporting.,HR
"Required Notices
 Injured Worker Notice: Injured workers are to be given the pamphlet ""Facts for Injured Workers"" (90-58882) within one working day of the employer receiving notice or knowledge of a workers' compensation injury that results in lost time beyond the date of injury or which results in medical treatment beyond the first aid. (CA Labor Code §139.6)",HR
Workplace Crime Notice: Requires every employer to give any employee who is a victim of acrime that occurred at the employee’s place of employment a written notice that the employee is eligible for workers’ compensation for injuries that are the result of a workplace crime. (CA Labor Code §3553),HR
"Injury Report: Employees must be given ""First Report of Injury – Employee Claim Form"" (DWC – 1) within one working day of the employer receiving notice or knowledge of workers’ compensation injury that results in a loss of time beyond the date of injury or which results in medical treatment beyond first aid. (CA Labor Code §139.6)",HR
Employer’s Report of Injury DLSR Form 5020: California law requires employers to report to the workers compensation carrier within five days of knowledge every occupational injury or illness which results in lost time beyond the date of the incident or requires medical treatment beyond first aid.,HR
"Personal Physician Choice: Employers must advise all employees of their right to designate a personal physician for treatment in the event of a work injury or illness (this is a posting requirement). In addition, the employer must furnish the employee a form on which to make this request. (CA Labor Code §3552).",HR
"Harassment
STANDARDS OF CONDUCT
AB 1825 (California's sexual harassment training law) mandates sexual harassment training for California supervisors. The basic provisions of California's AB 1825 state that companies with 50 or more employees must provide two hours of training every two years. New hires and employee promoted to supervisory positions must be trained within six months of their assumption of a supervisory position, and thereafter, every two years.",HR
Failure to comply opens the door to harassment lawsuits. Plaintiffs will argue that the failure to provide AB 1825-mandated sexual harassment training is evidence of an employer's failure to take all reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment.,HR
Harassment is a form of discrimination that is unlawful under State and federal statutes. Any manager who becomes aware of possible sexual or any other harassment must immediately begin an investigation or refer the incident to the proper individual to begin the investigation in a timely and confidential manner.,HR
"Harassment is any verbal, physical or visual conduct that tends to belittle or provoke, and includes jokes, gestures, and derogatory remarks. Federal, state and local laws prohibit harassment based on a certain individual’s personal characteristics including an individual’s race, color, sex, national origin, ancestry, religion, marital status, age, and physical or mental ability.",HR
"Sexual harassment is any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, including sexual jokes, sexual innuendoes, obscenities and the display of sexually suggestive photographs.",HR
"An investigation will include interviewing the complaining Employee, the alleged harasser, any witnesses to the conduct, and any other person who may be mentioned during the course of the investigation as possibly having relevant information. The resulting determination should be communicated to the complaining Employee and the alleged harasser, and if harassment is found, a prompt and effective remedy should be provided to the complaining Employee and disciplinary action taken against the harasser. Ensure that no further harassment occurs, and prevent retaliation against the complaining Employee or any other Employee who participated in the investigation.",HR
"GINA & Medical Requests
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits employers from asking or obtaining genetic information about an employee, including almost any detail about their family's medical history. To avoid unintentional violations, all employers should take two steps:",HR
"First, train your supervisors to avoid asking employees about their family medical history. If an employee volunteers facts (e.g., ""My child is sick""), managers should not seek medical details or ask probing follow-up questions about the relative's (or the employee's) condition.
 Second, amend all forms that request health-related information to indicate that the provider is not to share any genetic information, including family medical history.",HR
"The reason for this second step (amending medical request forms) is to protect your organization in case you're given prohibited genetic information in response to a medical request. According to the proposed EEOC regulation §1635.8(b)(1), an improper disclosure of genetic information may be considered ""inadvertent"" — and thus an employer would incur no liability — if it takes advantage of a ""safe harbor"" by including the following warning in health-related requests:",HR
"""The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits employers and other entities covered by GINA Title II from requesting or requiring genetic information of employees or their family members. In order to comply with this law, we are asking that you not provide any genetic information when responding to this request for medical information. 'Genetic information,' as defined by GINA, includes an individual's family medical history, the results of an individual's or family member's genetic tests, the fact that an individual or an individual's family member sought or received genetic services, and genetic information of a fetus carried by an individual or an individual's family member or an embryo lawfully held by an individual or family member receiving assistive reproductive services.""",HR
"Off-Duty Conduct
You may not discriminate against Employees and job applicants on the basis of lawful conduct they engage in during non-working hours away from the employer's premises. However, should the outside activity of a Employee conflict with, detract from, or adversely affect the interest of the company, the Employee needs to be informed that the situation needs to be corrected or their future employment with the company could be affected.",HR
"Employers are restricted in inquiries into many areas of the private lives of both Employees and applicants, including some that have an impact upon the job. This includes Employees who take or have a second job and conduct that you feel to be morally in conflict with the business.",HR
"All Employees must be judged by the same performance standards and subjected to the company’s scheduling demands, regardless of any existing outside work requirements. Outside employment or activities should not be considered an excuse for poor job performance, absenteeism, tardiness, leaving early, or refusal to work overtime. Such conduct can result in termination of employment.",HR
"Drug and Alcohol Use
Employees must not report for work in an impaired condition resulting from the use of alcohol or drugs; or consume alcohol or posses or consume drugs while on duty.",HR
"If an Employee smells of alcohol or appears to be under the influence, the Employee should be sent home immediately. However, do not allow an Employee who is impaired to drive home from work. An impaired employee should never be allowed to drive, to protect the employee and others and to avoid being held liable for any accidents that occur, the Employee should call someone to pick him/her up, take public transportation or call a cab to drive the Employee home.",HR
"Punctuality and Attendance
If you have an Employee that is frequently absent review the attendance policy with the Employee immediately if you see a pattern of absenteeism starting to develop. Let the Employee know exactly what disciplinary procedures will follow if the problem continues. Make written notes of the conversation, including date and time.",HR
"Be consistent. If you ignore chronic absenteeism for one Employee and discipline another, you are risking a discrimination suit. When Employees realize they may face discipline, they may be less likely to take unauthorized time off. Every time you warn, suspend or terminate an Employee for excessive absenteeism, you send a message to the entire company.",HR
"Termination
In California, employees are presumed to be ""at will."" At-will employees may be terminated for any reason, so long as it's not illegal. Generally, employees that work under an employment contract can only be terminated for reasons specified in the contract.",HR
"It is the responsibility of managers to be impartial, objective and fair in the treatment of Employees whose employment is terminated, with all due respect for the Employee’s rights and privacy and with equal care in the protection of the company’s legal and proprietary rights.",HR
"A few words of advice may be all that is needed to resolve Employee problems requiring corrective action. More serious problems may require multiple meetings, written warnings or involuntary termination. Progressive discipline policies are not recommended as it could negate the At-Will employment status. There should always be two company representatives present during a discipline or termination meetings.",HR
"To administer an oral warning, meet privately with the Employee, explain the issue and give the Employee an opportunity to explain. Be sure to take notes summarizing the meeting including the date and time. If there is little or no improvement, you may choose to provide an Employee a written warning. Good documentation is essential.",HR
"Occasionally, an Employee will be terminated for gross misconduct, which is behavior so serious that the progressive discipline action would be impractical. Employees who fail to report to work and do not call in to report their absence can be terminated immediately. Generally Employees are considered to have voluntarily resigned their position after not reporting for work for three consecutive workdays.",HR
"If an Employee is being terminated for cause, managers may suspend an Employee and send them home. A follow-up appointment should be made to complete the termination within two working days. Exempt employees must be paid during the suspension.",HR
If the decision has been made to terminate an employee the discussion should not be a long and arduous process. A simple statement to the employee such as “The decision has been made to terminate your at-will employment” should suffice.,HR
"If you terminate a Employee, or lay him/her off with no specific return date, all wages and accrued paid time off earned are due and payable immediately. It is not acceptable to ask or require an Employee to wait until the next regular payday for his/her final wages.",HR
"You may not withhold a final paycheck. It is illegal to withhold a final paycheck to induce the former Employee to:
 Return cell phone, laptop computers, keys, or any other items belonging to the employer;
 Pay back money owed to the employer;
 Turn in expense reimbursement forms.",HR
All wages and accrued vacation for an Employee who quits with more than 72 hours notice are due and payable on the last day of work. All wages and accrued vacation for an Employee who quits with fewer than 72 hours notice are due and payable not later than 72 hours after notice is given. Weekend and holidays are considered in the 72 hour deadline.,HR
"Required Notices
 Employees laid off, discharged or placed on a leave of absence must receive the pamphlet ""For Your Benefit -- California’s Programs for the Unemployed"" (DE2320) by action's effective date. (U.I. Code §1089)",HR
"A ""Change of Status Notice"" must be given to all employees whose employment status has changed including those who are laid off, discharged, placed on leave of absence, or changed to Independent Contractor status by the effective date of the action. (U.I. Code §1089)",HR
Health Insurance Premium Payment Program (HIPP) Notice: Employers with 20 or more employees that provide health insurance are required to give terminating workers a special notification about the state sponsored HIPP program. This notice is in addition to any COBRA Notices and applies to both private and public employers. (CA Labor Code §2807),HR
"Insurance Privilege Rights: All employers (public and private) shall provide to employees upon termination notification of all continuation, disability extension and conversion options under any employer sponsored coverage that the employee may be eligible for after termination. The written notification must be given to the employee within 15 days from termination of employment or termination from the plan, such as expiration of their COBRA coverage. (CA Labor Code §2808, Health & Safety Code 1373.6(g))",HR
"Reference Checks
Information should not be provided to individuals outside the company regarding current or former Employees. It is important to note that whenever you provide information and statements about another person, you are dealing with an area of the law that may have potential liabilities if you are incorrect and cause injury to the person on which you are giving the reference. Remember that you can be held personally liable for the information you give. For this reason, outside inquires regarding current or former Employees must be in writing and should be referred to one person within the company that can reply to the request.",HR
"TIME OFF BENEFITS / LEAVES
PTO/Vacation/Sick Leaves
There is no legal requirement in California that an employer provide its employees with either paid or unpaid vacation time. However, if an employer does have an established policy, practice, or agreement to provide paid vacation, then certain restrictions are placed on the employer as to how it fulfills its obligation to provide vacation pay.",HR
"Under California law, earned vacation time is considered wages, and vacation time is earned, or vests, as labor is performed. For example, if an employee is entitled to two weeks (10 work days) of vacation per year, after six months of work he or she will have earned five days of vacation. Vacation pay accrues as it is earned, and cannot be forfeited, even upon termination of employment, regardless of the reason for the termination.",HR
"An employer can place a reasonable cap on vacation benefits that prevents an employee from earning vacation over a certain amount of hours. Even the cap, however, may be held an illegal forfeiture if it is determined to be a pretext to avoid section 227.3 of the Labor Code. For example, if an employer refuses to permit employees to take vacation, the cap may not be allowed because the employee cannot comply with the cap. Or, the employer’s cap may be so low that it is impossible for the employee to take sufficient vacation to stay below the cap.",HR
DLSE has repeatedly found vacation policies which provide that all vacation must be taken in the year it is earned (or in a very limited period following the accrual period) are unfair and will not be enforced by the Division – meaning you cannot cap your accrual at or below the annual accrual rate. The DLSE has stated that employees must be allowed a “reasonable” amount of time to use the vacation before a cap is reached. Although the DLSE has yet to define “reasonable”. A rule of thumb has been 1.5 or 2 times the annual accrual.,HR
"Upon termination of employment all earned and unused vacation must be paid to the employee at his or her final rate of pay.
There is also no legal requirement under California law for employers to provide paid sick leave (except in San Francisco). Sick leave does not need to rollover from year to year or be paid out at time of termination.",HR
"If an employer has a sick leave policy, the employer must permit an employee to use at least half of the accrued and available sick leave to attend to an illness of a child, parent, domestic partner, or spouse of the employee.",HR
"Floating Holiday Rules
Some companies provide ""floating holidays"" to employees. ""Floating holidays"" are paid days of time off that employees may take whenever they want. These special holidays, like other PTO, are treated like vacation days rather than regular holidays. This means that the rules regarding earning and forfeiting vacation days as described above applies to floating holidays.",HR
"If a company fails to pay terminated employees for earned but unused floating holidays, the company may be liable for waiting time penalties.",HR
"Bereavement
There is no requirement to provide paid bereavement to employees. Most companies provide three days of paid time off when the death of an immediate family member necessitates absence from work. Immediate family usually is defined as spouse/domestic partner, child, parent, brother or sister, grandparent, grandchild, mother-in-law or father-in-law including such persons in a step-relationship.",HR
"General Rule on Payment for Personal Leaves
Some companies provide employees with ""personal leave."" Personal leaves are usually offered to accommodate employees who need time off for reasons that are not addressed by other leave policies. Accordingly, companies are ordinarily free to establish the rules for employees on personal leave. But, whether companies are required to pay employees for personal leave depends on whether employees are non-exempt or are exempt employees.",HR
"Non-Exempt Employees
Employers are not required to pay non-exempt employees for personal leave, whether the leave is for an hour, a day, a week, or longer.",HR
"Basically, companies need only pay non-exempt employees for their work-time (hours worked). And, time off for personal leave is not considered work-time.",HR
"Exempt Employees
Employers must pay exempt employees (qualifying executive, administrative, and professional employees) while they're on personal leave if they take off less than a full workday. These employees may lose their exempt status if their salaries are docked for lost work-time.",HR
"However, employers need not pay exempt employees if a personal leave covers a full workday. And, although employers may not dock exempt employees' salaries for leave of less than a day, they may be able to subtract the time off from an employee's accrued paid time off.",HR
"Required Leaves
The following are additional leaves required by law. Some require that the time be paid while others do not.
Pregnancy Disability Leave (PDL)
An Employee who is pregnant may take up to four months of leave if she is disabled by her pregnancy. The four months of leave is allowed for each pregnancy, and is not an annual limit. The leave may be taken at any time, if in the opinion of the health care provider, she is disabled by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Once the Employee is no longer disabled, she is not entitled to PDL to simply be at home with her new baby (Note: this is where the family leave act can come into play).",HR
"You must place a woman returning from PDL in the same job she held before the leave or in a comparable position. A Employee who is unable to return to work after taking four months of PDL generally can be terminated, unless you have a policy granting longer leaves for other disabilities.",HR
"You must provide reasonable accommodation to pregnant Employees upon the advice of the Employee's health care provider. You must grant the request of a pregnant Employee to transfer to a less strenuous job, if such a job is available. In limited circumstances you may require the pregnant Employee to transfer to another job.",HR
You can require employees use up to two weeks of accrued time off if they are eligible for SDI or PFL (paid family leave). The employee can always request to use paid time off in lieu of the disability. When the employee is no longer eligible for SDI or PFL (the leave is now unpaid) the employer can require the use of accrued time off.,HR
"Required Notices
 Pregnancy Notice: Employers with five or more employees must furnish a pregnant employee a written notice with respect to the employee’s right to request a pregnancy disability leave or temporary transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous job if medically advisable (2 Cal. Code Regs. §7291.16). If the employer is covered by California Family Rights Act (CFRA – 50 or more employees) and 10% of the workforce speaks a language other than English, the notice must be translated into the language(s) spoken by such employees. (CA Code of Regulations (CCR), § 7279 (c))",HR
"Family & Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and/or the California Family
Rights Act (CFRA) Employers with 50 or more employees must provide employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job- protected leave during any 12-month period under the Family & Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and/or the California Family Rights Act (CFRA). Cover employers are required to maintain any preexisting group health coverage during the leave. When the employee returns to work, the employer is required to reinstate the employee to the same or an equivalent job with equivalent benefits pay, and all other terms and conditions of employment.",HR
"FMLA/CFRA entitles Employees to take up to 12 weeks leave within a 12-month period for:
 The birth of the employee’s child, or placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care (FMLA/CFRA);
 To care for the employee’s spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition (FMLA/CFRA);
 To care for the employee’s registered domestic partner (CFRA only);
 For a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform his or her job

 For any “qualifying exigency” (defined by federal regulation) because the employee is the spouse, son, daughter, or parent of an individual on active military duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty) in the Armed Forces in support of a contingency operation (FMLA only); or
 An employee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of a covered service member shall be entitled to a total of 26 workweeks of leave during a 12-month period to care for the service member (FMLA only).",HR

"Military Service Leave
You may not refuse to allow military leave, or refuse to re-employ an individual returning from military leave, simply because of the duration of the leave or any inconvenience it causes you.
Both federal and California law provide protection from discrimination for employees who leave their jobs to serve in the military.",HR
"Right to a Leave of Absence: Advance notice of a military leave of absence is not required if it is impossible or precluded by military necessity. To qualify for the right to leave and the right to reemployment, the employee must give advance written or verbal notice to his or her employer. The absence may not exceed five years combined from the same employer.

"Paid Time Off and Pension Issues: Employees are entitled to use accrued vacation or paid time off benefits for time served, provided the accrual occurred before the leave, but employers may not require the use of these benefits for time served. Generally, an employer may not treat the leave as a break in service for purposes of the employee’s participation in a pension plan. The time spent on leave is also considered time spent in service with the employer for purposes of accruing benefits (such as paid time off) and for the non-forfeitability of accrued benefits (such as health benefits or pensions).",HR
"Rights to Benefits and Seniority: Employees have the right to keep the seniority they earned up to the time they went on leave in addition to the level they would have earned had they continued work.

"In the US, there is no single, comprehensive federal (national) law regulating the collection and use of personal data. However, each Congressional term brings proposals to standardise laws at a federal level. Instead, the US has a patchwork system of federal and state laws and regulations that can sometimes overlap, dovetail and contradict one another.",Security
"n addition, there are many guidelines, developed by governmental agencies and industry groups that do not have the force of law, but are part of self-regulatory guidelines and frameworks that are considered ""best practices"". These self-regulatory frameworks have accountability and enforcement components that are increasingly being used as a tool for enforcement by regulators.",Security
"There are already a panoply of federal privacy-related laws that regulate the collection and use of personal data. Some apply to particular categories of information, such as financial or health information, or electronic communications. Others apply to activities that use personal information, such as telemarketing and commercial e-mail.",Security
"In addition, there are broad consumer protection laws that are not privacy laws as such, but have been used to prohibit unfair or deceptive practices involving the disclosure of, and security procedures for protecting, personal information.",Security
"Some of the most prominent federal privacy laws include, without limitation, the following:
The Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. §§41-58) (FTC Act) is a federal consumer protection law that prohibits unfair or deceptive practices and has been applied to offline and online privacy and data security policies. The FTC has brought many enforcement actions against companies failing to comply with posted privacy policies and for the unauthorised disclosure of personal data. ",Security
"The FTC is also the primary enforcer of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) (15 U.S.C. §§6501-6506), which applies to the online collection of information from children, and the Self-Regulatory Principles for Behavioural Advertising.",Security
"The Financial Services Modernization Act (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB)) (15 U.S.C. §§6801-6827) regulates the collection, use and disclosure of financial information. It can apply broadly to financial institutions such as banks, securities firms and insurance companies, and to other businesses that provide financial services and products.",Security
"GLB limits the disclosure of non-public personal information, and in some cases requires financial institutions to provide notice of their privacy practices and an opportunity for data subjects to opt out of having their information shared.",Security
"n addition, there are several Privacy Rules promulgated by national banking agencies and the Safeguards Rule, Disposal Rule, and Red Flags Rule issued by the FTC that relate to the protection and disposal of financial data.",Security
"The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) (42 U.S.C. §1301 et seq.) regulates medical information. It can apply broadly to health care providers, data processors, pharmacies and other entities that come into contact with medical information. The Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information (HIPAA Privacy Rule) (45 C.F.R. Parts 160 and 164) apply to the collection and use of protected health information (PHI).",Security
The Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information (HIPAA Security Rule) (45 C.F.R. 160 and 164) provides standards for protecting medical data. The Standards for Electronic Transactions (HIPAA Transactions Rule) (45 C.F.R. 160 and 162) applies to the electronic transmission of medical data. These HIPAA rules were revised in early 2013 under the HIPAA “Omnibus Rule”.,Security
The HIPAA Omnibus Rule also revised the Security Breach Notification Rule (45 C.F.R. Part 164) which requires covered entities to provide notice of a breach of protected health information.,Security
"Under the revised rule, a covered entity must provide notice of acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of PHI in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule, unless the covered entity or business associate demonstrates that there is a low probability that the protected health information has been compromised.",Security
"The Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. §1681) (and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (Pub. L. No. 108-159) which amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act) applies to consumer reporting agencies, those who use consumer reports (such as a lender) and those who provide consumer-reporting information (such as a credit card company).",Security

"The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (18 U.S.C. §2510) and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. §1030) regulate the interception of electronic communications and computer tampering, respectively. A class action complaint filed in late 2008 alleged that internet service providers (ISPs) and a targeted advertising company violated these statutes by intercepting data sent between individuals' computers and ISP servers (known as deep packet inspection).",Security
This is the same practice engaged in by Phorm in the UK and several UK telecommunications companies that resulted in an investigation by the European Commission.,Security
"In 2016, Congress enacted the Judicial Redress Act, giving citizens of certain ally nations (notably, EU member states) the right to seek redress in US courts for privacy violations when their personal information is shared with law enforcement agencies.",Security
"There are also many federal security and law enforcement laws that regulate the use of personal information, but these laws are outside the scope of this chapter.
In addition to the above laws, there are also many guidelines issued by industry groups that are not legally enforceable but are generally considered ""best practices"" in those industries (such as the payment card, mobile marketing and online advertising industries).",Security
"For example, the advertising industry continues to develop its self-regulatory programme for online behavioural advertising. This programme requires members of various advertising industry trade groups to comply with the groups' guidelines for online behavioural advertising, which largely mirror the FTC's guidelines.",Security
The programme includes an icon that members should place on their websites if tracking data is collected. The icon links to information about the website's data collection practices and how an individual can opt out of some online tracking. The self-regulatory programme was also expanded in 2015 to the mobile environment.,Security
"State privacy laws
There are many laws at the state level that regulate the collection and use of personal data, and the number grows each year. Some federal privacy laws pre-empt state privacy laws on the same topic.",Security
"For example, the federal law regulating commercial e-mail and the sharing of e-mail addresses pre-empts most state laws regulating the same activities. Conversely, there are many federal privacy laws that do not pre-empt state laws, which means that a company can find itself in the position of trying to comply with federal and state privacy laws that regulate the same types of data (for example, medical or health records) or types of activity.",Security
"Most states have enacted some form of privacy legislation, however California leads the way in the privacy arena, having enacted multiple privacy laws, some of which have far-reaching effects at a national level.",Security
California was the first state to enact a security breach notification law (California Civil Code §1798.82). The law requires any person or business that owns or licenses computerised data that includes personal information to disclose any breach of the security of the system to all California residents whose unencrypted personal information was acquired by an unauthorised person.,Security
"Most of the early state security breach notification laws mirrored California's law, and tended to be reactive, that is, they established requirements for responding to a security breach. More recently, a number of states laws have enacted more prescriptive and preventative laws, that is, these laws are more stringent and actually establish requirements to avoid a security breach.",Security
"The best example of a preventative-type of law is the Massachusetts Regulation (201 CMR 17.00), which prescribes in considerable detail an extensive list of technical, physical and administrative security protocols aimed at protecting personal information that affected companies must implement into their security architecture, and describe in a comprehensive written information security programme.",Security

"The California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (S.B. 178), which severely limits the ability of government authorities to seek electronic communication information for law enforcement purposes.",Security
"Several amendments to security breach notification law. S.B. 570 amends the required content of security breach notices, requiring that notices clearly and conspicuously display certain prescribed headings. A.B. 964 now defines the term ''encrypted'' for purposes of California's breach notification law as ''rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to an unauthorised person through a security technology or methodology generally accepted in the field of information security.'' Both amendments went into effect on 1 January 2016.",Security

Request disclosures of information about how information is collected and shared.
Instruct a company not to sell their data.",Security

The CAN-SPAM Act is the federal anti-spam law that applies very broadly to commercial e-mail in the US (codified at 15 U.S.C. §§7701-7713 and at 18 U.S.C. §1037). FTC Rules implementing CAN-SPAM are collected at 16 CFR Part 316. Federal Communications Commission Rules regarding text messages that are subject to CAN-SPAM are in 47 CFR 64.3100.,Security
"CAN-SPAM addresses two types of e-mail:
Commercial e-mail. This is defined as any electronic mail message the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service (including content on an internet website operated for a commercial purpose).
A transactional or relationship message. This is a message whose primary purpose is to:
facilitate, complete or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient previously agreed to enter into with the sender;
provide product warranty, product recall or safety information concerning a product purchased by the recipient;
provide account information or employment or related benefit plan information;
to deliver goods or services, or updates or upgrades that the recipient is entitled to receive pursuant to a transaction previously entered into with the sender.",Security
"Commercial e-mail must include the following:
Accurate and non-misleading routing and header information, that is, ""From"", ""To"", and ""Reply To"" fields.
A ""Subject"" line that is not deceptive.
A notice that the recipient has the right to opt out of receiving future e-mail messages from the sender. The law does not specify where the notice must appear, but it must be clear and conspicuous. The recipient should not have to search the message to find it.
An internet-based opt-out mechanism capable of receiving opt-out requests for at least 30 days after transmission of the message. The sender must honour an opt-out request within ten business days.
A clear and conspicuous identification that the e-mail is an advertisement or solicitation. This requirement does not apply if the sender has the recipient's affirmative consent to send commercial e-mail. Affirmative consent requires that the recipient expressly consented to receive commercial e-mail from the sender. If the sender does not have the recipient's affirmative consent, the e-mail must be identified as an advertisement or solicitation. A sender does not have to actually use the words advertisement or solicitation, but the message must clearly be identified as a commercial offer. Phrases such as ""you may be interested in this great offer"" or ""for a limited time, we are offering special rates"" would probably suffice, if conspicuously included.
The sender's physical postal address (PO boxes and commercial mail drops that meet certain US Postal Service requirements suffice as a sender's physical postal address).",Security
"All transactional or relationship messages must include accurate and non-misleading routing information. For example, the ""From"" and ""To"" lines must not be misleading.",Security
"CAN-SPAM imposes obligations on senders and initiators. A sender is the person or entity who initiates a commercial e-mail message and whose product, service or website is advertised or promoted by the message. Some e-mails, such as in a co-branded promotion, can have multiple senders, all of whom must comply with CAN-SPAM requirements. An initiator is the person or entity who originates or transmits a commercial e-mail message, but does not include the service that is responsible solely for the routine conveyance of the message. Multiple persons or entities can qualify as initiators and can therefore all be subject to CAN-SPAM requirements.",Security
"Each separate e-mail in violation of the law is subject to penalties of up to USD16,000, and more than one person can be held responsible for violations. For example, both the company whose product is promoted in the message and the company that originated the message can be legally responsible. E-mail that makes misleading claims about products or services can also be subject to laws outlawing deceptive advertising, such as section 5 of the FTC Act.",Security
"The CAN-SPAM Act has certain aggravated violations that can give rise to additional fines. The law provides for criminal penalties, including imprisonment, for:
Accessing someone else's computer to send spam without permission.
Using false information to register for multiple e-mail accounts or domain names.
Relaying or retransmitting multiple spam messages through a computer to mislead others about the origin of the message.
Harvesting e-mail addresses or generating them through a dictionary attack (sending e-mail to addresses made up of random letters and numbers in the hope of reaching valid ones).
Taking advantage of open relays or open proxies without permission.",Security
"There are few limits on the transfer of personal data outside the US. Several states have enacted laws that limit or discourage state agencies or state contractors from outsourcing data processing beyond US borders, but these laws are typically limited to state government agencies and private companies that contract to perform services for or provide goods to state agencies.",Security
"However, the position of the FTC and other regulators is that the applicable US laws and regulations still apply to the data after it leaves the US, and US regulated entities remain liable for:

"Under the HIPAA, if a business associate has signed a business associate agreement that is HIPAA compliant, and the disclosure of PHI is otherwise permitted without obtaining consent from the data subject, the agreement is generally sufficient to effect the transfer.
