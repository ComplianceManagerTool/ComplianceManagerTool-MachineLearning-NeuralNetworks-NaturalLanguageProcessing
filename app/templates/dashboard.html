california do enact as follows:\n   section 1. this measure shall be known and may be cited\n   as “the california consumer privacy act of 2018.”\n   sec. 2. the legislature finds and declares that:\n      (a) in 1972, california voters amended the california\n   constitution to include the right of privacy among the “inalienable”\n     rights of all people. the amendment established a legal and\n    enforceable right of privacy for every californian. fundamental\n   to this right of privacy is the ability of individuals to control the\n   use, including the sale, of their personal information.\n (b) since california voters approved the right of privacy, the\n   california legislature has adopted specific mechanisms to\n  safeguard californians’ privacy, including the onprivacy\n protection act, the privacy rights for california minors in the\ndigital world act, and shine the light, a california law intended\n to give californians the ‘who, what, where, and when’ of how\nbusinesses handle consumers' personal information.\n(c) at the same time, california is one of the world’s leaders in\nthe development of new technologies and related industries. yet\nthe proliferation of personal information has limited californians’\nability to properly protect and safeguard their privacy. it is almost\nimpossible to apply for a job, raise a child, drive a car, or make an\nappointment without sharing personal information.\n(d) as the role of technology and data in the every daily lives\n of consumers increases, there is an increase in the amount of\n  personal information shared by consumers with businesses.\ncalifornia law has not kept pace with these developments and the\n                                                                                   93", '         ab 375                            —4—\n   personal privacy implications surrounding the collection, use, and\n   protection of personal information.\n      (e) many businesses collect personal information from\n    california consumers. they may know where a consumer lives\n    and how many children a consumer has, how fast a consumer\n   drives, a consumer’s personality, sleep habits, biometric and health\n   information, financial information, precise geolocation information,\n   and social networks, to name a few categories.\n   (f) the unauthorized disclosure of personal information and the\nloss of privacy can have devastating effects for individuals, ranging\n  from financial fraud, identity theft, and unnecessary costs to\npersonal time and finances, to destruction of property, harassment,\nreputational damage, emotional stress, and even potential physical\nharm.\n(g) in march 2018, it came to light that tens of millions of people\n had their personal data misused by a data mining firm called\n   cambridge analytica. a series of congressional hearings\n highlighted that our personal information may be vulnerable to\n misuse when shared on the internet. as a result, our desire for\nprivacy controls and transparency in data practices is heightened.\n   (h) people desire privacy and more control over their\n information. california consumers should be able to exercise\ncontrol over their personal information, and they want to be certain\n   that there are safeguards against misuse of their personal\ninformation. it is possible for businesses both to respect consumers’\n privacy and provide a high level transparency to their business\npractices.\n  (i) therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to further\n californians’ right to privacy by giving consumers an effective\nway to control their personal information, by ensuring the following\nrights:\n(1) the right of californians to know what personal information\nis being collected about them.\n (2) the right of californians to know whether their personal\ninformation is sold or disclosed and to whom.\n(3) the right of californians to say no to the sale of personal\ninformation.\n(4) the right of californians to access their personal information.\n(5) the right of californians to equal service and price, even if\nthey exercise their privacy rights.\n                                                                                 93', '                                        —5—                            ab 375\n   sec. 3. title 1.81.5 (commencing with section 1798.100) is\n
